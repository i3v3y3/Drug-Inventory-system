# Drug Inventory system

Hello

This code is based on C++ and a MySQL database. The application is fundamentally for drug stores or even pharmacies to keep records of their drugs. There are two clients within the framework, the individual at the front desk offering the drugs and the other user who restocks the drugs.
There's one source file and one header record for the total venture. The header record contains the work for the procurement individual who restocks the drugs.

I associated the application to my MySQL table that had the data, you will be able to see comments as to where to find the table's details.

I introduced the MySQL connector for C++ making it easier to code in between the database and the programmer.

This is often a spine code for anybody attempting to actualize a solid stock framework that interfaces to their database in MySQL.

Much appreciated!!
